# Maze-Solver-Maze-Drawer

Implements Stack and Queue interfaces using Linked Lists to solve and generate mazes. Solves a Maze using Breadth First Search (BFS) by using a Queue interface (implemented with a Linked List). Draws a Maze using Depth First Search (DFS) by using a Stack interface (implemented with a Linked Lsit)

## Installation and Execution
Requirements: ```javac``` and ```jar```

### Draw Maze
```
javac *.java
java DrawMaze <output file> <length of maze> <height of maze>
```
```example usage: java DrawMaze temp.txt 10 10```

### Solve Maze
```
javac *.java
java DrawMaze <output file>
```
```example usage: java SolveMaze temp.txt```

### Misc
Recommend generating a Maze and output it's contents to a ```temp.txt``` file before solving.
